## ðŸŒŸ Next Steps
Creating a proprietary API. As is, this project doesn't create much value as it relies on the TicketMaster API and the TM team could incorporate a feature similiar to this project. But by creating an API for small business availability (such as escape rooms, axe throwing etc.) where TM doesn't have event data, value can be created. From here, it would make sense to book/pay for events in the web app. Also, the app could look prettier, but that's not a priority.
